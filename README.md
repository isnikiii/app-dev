**My Favorite Series: Harry Potter**
The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is a global phenomenon that follows the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his journey to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Spanning seven books (and eight films), the series explores themes of friendship, bravery, love, and the battle between good and evil.
